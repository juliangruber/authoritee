Add authoritative nodes to your net of scuttlebutt models.

## Usage

In a game you might want to limit players' movements to no more than 1 length
entity per second, to prevent cheating. 

On the server use authoritee:

```javascript
var Authoritee = require('authoritee')
var player = new Authoritee()

// There are two modes: relative and absolute.
// Here relative is better
player.onRel('cords', function (dcords, dt) {
  var delta = Math.sqrt(dcords.x * dcords.x, dcords.y * dcords.y)
  if (delta > dt / 1000 || delta > 1) dcords.x = dcords.y = 0
  return dcords
})

// Replicate
var ps = player.createStream()

var http = require('http')
var server = http.createServer()
server.listen(3000)

var shoe = require('shoe')
var sock = shoe(function (stream) {
  ps.pipe(stream).pipe(ps)
})
sock.install(server, '/stream')
```

On the client just use scuttlebutt:

```javascript
var Model = require('scuttlebutt/model')
var player = new Model()

player.on('update', function (key, value) {
  if (key == 'cords') moveTo(value.x, value.y)
})

// Just apply updates as you wish, the server will update your model
// if you did something wrong

player.set('cords', { x : 10, y : 35 })
// authorative model replicates good initial cords

// after 1 second
player.set('cords', { x : 11, y : 35 })
// authorative model replicates good cords

// now a cheat
player.set('cords', { x : 30, y : 59 })
// authorative model replicates corrected cords and corrects the client

// Replicate
var ps = player.createStream()
var shoe = require('shoe')
ps.pipe(shoe('/stream')).pipe(ps)
```

## API

### Authoritee()

create a new `authoratee` model.

### Model#set(key, value)

store `value` at `key` inside the model.

### Model#get(key)

get the `value` associated with `key`.

### Model#onAbs(key, cb)

Executes `cb` whenever a node tries to change the `value` stored at `key` with
the following arguments:

* the proposed new value
* the current value
* the time in miliseconds that passed since the last valid update

The value that `cb` returns will be stored at `key`. __You need to do this
even if you just accept__.

If no listeners are registered for changes to `key`, all changes are accepted.

### Model#onRel(key, cb)

A convenience wrapper around `Model#onAbs(key, cb)`

The following arguments are passed:

* the calculate change of value, supporting numbers and numbers in objects
* the time in miliseconds that passed since the last valid update

The `change` object/number that `cb` returns will be applied to the curent
`value`.

If no listeners are registered for changes to `key`, all changes are accepted.

### Model#on('update', function (key, value, source))

see dominictarr/scuttlebutt's README.

### Model#createStream()

create a duplex stream for replicating with other scuttlebutt / authoritee nodes

see dominictarr/scuttlebutt's README.
